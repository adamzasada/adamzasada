- 👋 Hi, I’m Adam Zasada aka [adag1oeth](https://www.x.com/adag1oeth/).
- 👀 Founder of [Soul Agents](https://www.x.com/soul_agents/) - building autonomous AI agents for Web3 - and ex-founder of [0xKYC](https://www.x.com/0xKYC/), a (soon to be) open-source decentralized identity protocol backed by Outlier Ventures, BuffiCorn Ventures and Celestia’s CTO, amongst other angels 😇.
- 🌱 I code in TypeScript, Python, MongoDB, and Vector databases for RAG-based systems. Previously built Web3 and BaaS banking infrastructure (e.g., Revolut). Fun fact: I was the youngest coding student at [PJATK](https://pja.edu.pl/) (age 12) and also a DJ at Café Mambo in Ibiza, playing with Solomun and others.
- 💞️ Currently developing AI-driven Web3 tools at Soul Agents, where we won 3rd place in a hackathon. - check the [trading repo](https://www.github.com/adamzasada/trading/).
